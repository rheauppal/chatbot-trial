        "content": "Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array. In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted. Merge Sort Algorithm Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. It follows the divide-and-conquer approach to sort a given array of elements.  Here\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works: Let\u2019s sort the array or list [38, 27, 43, 10] using Merge Sort Let\u2019s look at the working of above example: Divide: Conquer: Merge: Therefore, the sorted list is [10, 27, 38, 43]. Time Complexity: Space Complexity: O(n), Additional space is required for the temporary array used during merging. Quick Links: "

        "content": "Hashing is a fundamental data structure that efficiently stores and retrieves data in a way that allows for quick access. It involves mapping data to a specific index in a hash table using a hash function that enables fast retrieval of information based on its key. This method is commonly used in databases, caching systems, and various programming applications to optimize search and retrieval operations. Data Structures \u2013 Hashing Table of Content Hashing is a technique used in data structures to store and retrieve data efficiently. It involves using a hash function to map data items to a fixed-size array which is called a hash table. How it works: A hash table is also known as a hash map. It is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to map keys to a fixed-size array, called a hash table. This allows in faster search, insertion, and deletion operations. The hash function is a function that takes a key and returns an index into the hash table. The goal of a hash function is to distribute keys evenly across the hash table, minimizing collisions (when two keys map to the same index). Common hash functions include: A hash collision occurs when two different keys map to the same index in a hash table. This can happen even with a good hash function, especially if the hash table is full or the keys are similar. Causes of Hash Collisions: There are two types of collision resolution techniques: Hash tables are used in a wide variety of applications, including: Quick Links : Recommended: H "

        "content": "Given an array of integers. All numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once. Find the number in O(n) time & constant extra space. Example :\u00a0 Input:\u00a0 arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4}Output: 2\u00a0 Approach (Brute-force): One solution is to check every element if it appears once or not. Once an element with a single occurrence is found, return it.\u00a0 Below is the implementation of the approach:                               Time complexity of this solution is O(n2)Auxiliary Space: O(1) as constant space is used. A better solution is to use hashing.\u00a0 This solution works in O(n) time but requires extra space. The best solution is to use XOR. XOR of all array elements gives us the number with a single occurrence. The idea is based on the following two facts.\u00a0 Below are implementations of above algorithm.\u00a0                                           Time Complexity: O(n)Auxiliary Space: O(1) Another approach:\u00a0This is not an efficient approach but just another way to get the desired results. If we add each number once and multiply the sum by 2, we will get twice the sum of each element of the array. Then we will subtract the sum of the whole array from the twice_sum and get the required number (which appears once in the array).Array [] : [a, a, b, b, c, c, d]\u00a0Mathematical Equation = 2*(a+b+c+d) \u2013 (a + a + b + b + c + c + d)\u00a0 In more simple words: 2*(sum_of_array_without_duplicates) \u2013 (sum_of_array)\u00a0 As we know that set does not contain any duplicate element we will be using the set here. Below is the implementation of above approach:\u00a0                               Time Complexity: O(nlogn)Auxiliary Space: O(n) Another approach: This is an efficient approach for finding the single element in a list of duplicate elements. In this approach, we are using binary search algorithm to find the single element in the list of duplicates elements. Before that, we need to make sure if the array is sorted. The first step is to sort the array because binary search algorithm wont work if the array is not sorted.\u00a0 Now let us move to the binary search implementation: There are two halves that are created by the only single element present in the array which are left half and right half. Now if there are duplicates present in the left half, then the 1st instance of the duplicate element in the left half is an even index and the 2nd instance is an odd index. The opposite of the left half happens in the right half(1st instance is odd index and the second instance is even index). Now apply binary search algorithm: Implementation:                                     Time Complexity: O(nlogn)Auxiliary Space: O(1) Another Approach:- We can simply use a hashmap to store the frequency of the elements and after that we can iterate the hashmap to find the element with frequency 1. Code for the above approach:                               Time Complexity:- O(N)Auxiliary Space:- O(N) R "

MS Excel is widely used for various purposes because the data is easy to save, and information can be added and removed without any discomfort or hard work. Anyone can learn how to use and take advantage of the program\u2019s powerful features. The easiest way to get started with Excel is to use Microsoft 365, previously known as Office 365. It does not require downloading or installation of the program. Before you start using it, it\u2019s really important to understand what is where in the window. Some parts of the Excel window (like the Ribbon and Scroll bars) are standard in most Microsoft programs. However, there are other features that are more specific to spreadsheets, such as the formula bar, name box, and worksheet tabs.  A collection of worksheets is referred to as a workbook (spreadsheet). Workbooks are your Excel files. There are various ways to begin working with an Excel workbook. Excel files are called workbooks. There are various ways to begin working with an Excel workbook. You can either start from scratch or use a pre-designed template to create a new workbook. Steps to Create a new blank workbook: Step 1: Select the File tab Step 2: Click New Step 3: Click Blank Workbook Step 4: A new blank workbook will appear. You can also use Templates. A template is a predesigned spreadsheet you can use to create a new workbook quickly. Templates often include custom formatting and predefined formulas. Whenever we create a new workbook in Excel and insert the data into it, then we must save our workbook so that our data is not lost. As in previous versions of Excel, you can save files locally to your computer You can also save your workbook to the cloud and also export your workbook with others. Save: When you save a file, you\u2019ll only need to choose a file name and location the first time. Then you can just use the save command to save it with the same name and location. Save As: When you use Save As, you\u2019ll need to choose a different name and /or location for the copied version. Excel automatically saves your workbooks to a temporary folder while you are working on them. If you forget to save your changes or if Excel crashes, you can restore the file using AutoRecover. A Worksheet is a collection of cells(basic data unit in the worksheet). Where you can store and manipulate data. Adding information to multiple worksheets simultaneously is also easily accomplished by grouping worksheets. In Excel, Worksheets can be easily added, renamed, and deleted. When you open an Excel Workbook, there are three sheets by default and the name on them is sheet1, sheet2, and sheet3 you can change the name. You can perform multiple functions in Worksheets such as View a Worksheet, Select a Worksheet, Insert a Worksheet, Rename a Worksheet, and Delete a Worksheet. Every row and column of a new workbook is set with the same height and width. Excel allows you to modify column width and row height in different ways including wrapping text and merging cells. After working with a workbook for a while, you may want to Insert new columns or rows, Delete certain rows and columns, Move them to a different location in the worksheet, or even Hide them. You can easily search your workbook using the Find feature, which also allows you to modify using the Replace feature. Excel includes a Spell-check tool that ensures everything is spelled correctly in your workbook. All cell content uses the same Formatting by default, which can make it difficult to read a workbook with a lot of information. Data Formatting can be used to Change the font size, To change the font, To change the font color, and many more. The most important and useful feature of Microsoft Excel is to Calculate numerical information using formulas. Excel can perform different calculations using mathematical operators (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) We can Insert a formula, Create a Formula, and Edit a Formula. Also, values can be modified on the basis of Cell References. A function is a predefined formula that is used to perform calculations using specific values in a sequence. Excel has many common functions that can be used to quickly find the Sum, Average, Count, Maximum Value, and Minimum Value of a range of cells. Excel Workbooks are designed to store a lot of information no matter you are working with 10 cells or 10,000 cells. Excel has many features to help you Organize your data and Find what you need. Sometimes you may want to see certain rows and columns all the time in your worksheet, mainly Header cells. By freezing rows and Columns in place, you\u2019ll able to scroll through your content. You can quickly reorganize your data in a sequence you want in your worksheet by sorting your data. You can sort your data alphabetically, numerically, and in many other ways. Filters can be applied to data in your worksheet allowing you to view only the information you need. Formatting Data as a Table can improve the overall look of your workbook and help you to organize your content and make your data easier to use. Worksheets with a lot of content can sometimes feel overwhelming. Excel provides you with the feature of organizing data into Groups, allowing you to easily show and hide different sections of your worksheet. The Subtotal command allows you to quickly summarize data. Below are some functions that you can learn in Groups and subtotal. After entering your data in the worksheet, you may want to format your data as a table. They will help to organize your data content and make your data easier to use and understand. Excel has many predefined table styles, allowing you to create tables quickly and easily. Step 1: Select the Cells you want to format as a table Step 2: Click the Format as Table in the styles group from the Home tab Step 3: Now select Table Style from the drop-down menu Step 4: Confirm the cell range for the table Step 5: Click OK if your table has headers Step 6: The cell range will be formatted in the selected table style. It is easy to modify the look of the table after adding it to a worksheet. Excel includes several options for customizing a table, including adding rows or columns, changing the table style, Modifying the table style options, and removing a table. It is difficult to examine Excel workbooks that contain a lot of data. Charts help you to illustrate your workbook data graphically, which makes it easy to examine and compare the Excel workbook and make better decisions. You can learn how to insert and modify Excel Charts to visualize comparisons in your data. There are many options to change the chart and layout style. Similar to charts Conditional formatting provides a way to visualize data and make worksheets easier to understand. It allows you to automatically apply formattings- such as formattings, and data bars to one or more cells. You can use Conditional formatting by using the below steps. Step 1: Select desired cells Step 2: Click on the Conditional formatting command from the Home Tab Step 3: Select the desired rule from the menu that appears Step 4: Enter the desired values in the dialog box Step 5: Select Formatting styles. You can also use Conditional Formatting presets and Remove the Conditional Formatting. If your workbook contains lots of data, it can sometimes be difficult to analyze all the information in your worksheet. PivotTables can help to make worksheets more manageable by summarizing data and allowing you to manipulate it in different ways. Step1: Select the Create or cells Step 2: From the Insert tab click on the PivotTable Step 3: Choose your settings in the Create PivotTable Dialog box and click ok Step 4: A blank PivotTable and Field List will appear in a new worksheet. Macro allows automating repetitive tasks in Microsoft Excel. Some tasks need to be performed multiple times and repetition of all actions would consume time. In these scenarios, Macros help in automating these tasks. A Macro is the set of actions that we run as many times as required to perform a particular task. When the macro is Created, the whole mouse clicks, and the keystrokes get recorded. You can learn how to Enable a Macro, How to Record a Macro, and How to Run a Macro in different ways. VBA stands for Visual Basic application is a readable and editable programming code that gets generated when the macro is recorded. It is now used with Microsoft Office applications such as MS Excel, MS Word, and MS- Access. With VBA, you can refer to the Excel Objects and use the properties, methods, and events associated with them. These are the two most powerful features that allow you to work with others on the same spreadsheet: Comments and Co-authoring these features come in the role when you\u2019re working on a workbook and find that you need the help of others.

        "content": "Product management is an all-around process that involves planning, development, launching, marketing, and post-sales improvement of a product and service. Product Management includes the complete lifecycle of the product or service, from idea generation to development of the product to the final launch. The product manager is an entity or a person who is responsible for looking after all these issues and collaborating with different teams, to bring out the best product that fits every need of customers. Product Management \u2013 Beginner to  Advanced Tutorial Product management is the process of overseeing the development, marketing, and enhancement of a product or service throughout its lifecycle. It involves understanding customer needs, market trends, and competitive landscape to create and manage a product strategy that aligns with the company\u2019s objectives. Product managers work closely with cross-functional teams, including engineering, design, marketing, and sales, to ensure the successful delivery and ongoing improvement of the product. Product management is important as it ensures that a company is developing the right product for the right customer, at the right time, which in turn results in: Table of Content Product management is a general and evolving topic that has great influence on stakeholders and organisations. Product managers develop great products by combining tech knowledge, commercial knowledge, and user attention. Some of the important people that plays a significant role in product management: Product Management involves studying the market, understanding the sentiment of the market and analysing what is the need of customer, having a deep research about the market and creating a vision about the solution to withstand the problem. After deep market analysis, it is required to study the mindset of the customer, because it helps in pinpointing the need and providing the most appropiate product or service. The First step of Idea generation is understanding the direction of wind, just as a sailor must know the prevailing winds to effectively navigate the seas, similarly product manager must understand the minute details of market landscape to make successful products. This involves delving into market research and crafting a clear vision that aligns with customer needs and industry trends.  Market Understanding plays a cruical role in product management as it helps to craft the most suitable idea according to the current customer demand and market trends. Once we are done with analysing the market, we are required to gain an in-depth understanding of the market using multiple indicators such as TAM, Market Sizing and Competition Analysis. After understanding the market, then user research is done. User research  is the systematic study of users and their needs, behaviors, and attitudes to inform the design and development of products or services. It is an important part of the product management processes, as it helps to ensure that products are designed to meet the needs of real users. User research can be conducted using a variety of methods, including surveys, interviews, usability testing, and user observation. After an intense market and user research, we are ready with our ideas. Now we have to finalize the product and craft the roadmap of the product development and management. This phase involves more in-depth analysis of Product Planning. Calculating the budget, analysing it\u2019s performance in the market, cost benefit analysis, product profitability are all part of planning. The product Manager are reponsible for planning the complete roadmap of the product development keeps every minute detail in mind.  Product Research is the second level of product management. It involves analysing the actual demand of the product in the market. Designing the optimal structure of the product, that ensure smooth workflow. This step involves calculating the product growth graph, and improvising it, if it is underperforming. Once you are sure with the basic structure of the product. It is required to design the roadmap of the product as it describes the work division and roles of the team in the product management process. This roadmap helps in better communication of different team in product development and management. Once a strong roadmap has been created, we will handle the finances now. This is done by creating a thorough budget and keeping careful track on expenditures. Potential revenue streams will also be identified, and we\u2019ll actively seek them. This include limit budget for useles, thigns and focusing on major prospects. Once the financial planning is in order, it is important to establish clear product metrics to gauge the product\u2019s sucess and identify the areas that need improvement. Product metrics are quantifiable data points that measure how users interact with and experience the product.  We are all set to execute the development cycle, but wait one more thing we have to consider that is \u201cPriority\u201d. This means that which task should be done first and which should be done at last.  It\u2019s time to execute the development cycle, this can be regulated using some framework and methodology, these framework are chosen on basis of work and prioritzation. Using these methodologies and framework results in smoother workflow. Product management frameworks provide a systematic approach to product development and management, helping product teams to stay organized, focused, and aligned on their goals. They offer a set of processes and tools that can be used to guide for product lifecycle, from ideation to launch and beyond. Product teams may enhance productivity, lower risk, and raise success rates by following a framework. Let us learn about some framework that are used in product management. Agile is a product development methodology that emphasizes iterative development, early delivery, and continuous improvement. It is a flexible and adaptable approach that is well-suited to the rapidly changing world of product development. Agile teams work in short, incremental cycles, or \u201csprints,\u201d typically lasting two weeks. At the end of each sprint, the team delivers a working product increment to the customer or stakeholder. This allows the team to get feedback early and often, and to make changes as needed. Product lifecycle can be used in conjunction with Agile to create a more comprehensive and effective product development process. It is important to know why this lifecycle is important. It helps to identify the key milestones in the product lifecycle and improve communication and collaboration between different teams involved in the product development process. Once the development cycle is complete, the product goes through intense testing process. This phase ensures that the product is upto the mark and is qualifying all the criteria of the initial requirement. After the testing process the launching phase starts, this includes selecting the proper marketing channel and platform to advertise. Product marketing is done by selecting the most optimal channel for marketing and branding. It involves creating and executing a plan to generate awareness and demand for the product, as well as educating and nurturing potential customers. Experimentation and A/B testing are two crucial methods for enhancing product marketing. Comparing two iterations of a website, landing page, email, or other marketing asset to evaluate which one works better is known as A/B testing. Experimentation is evaluating many marketing approaches and techniques to see which ones are most effective for a certain target market. After extensive testing the product is ready to be released in the market. Product Launch plays a cruical role in product management, since it is said the \u201cFIRST IMPRESSION IS THE LAST IMPRESSION\u201d so if a product is not launched properly in the market, it can result in low reach of the product. After the launch of the product and marketing, it is important to look after the customer satisfaction. As it is the major indicator if the target customer are happy with the product and service. This phase involve tracking the performance of the product using multiple metrics. Looking after legalities of the product are the part of these phase. Product tracking is the practise of gathering and evaluating information to determine a product\u2019s market performance. Making smarter business decisions, creating new marketing campaigns, and refining the product are all possible with this data. Product sales teams are in charge of creating and putting into practise sales strategies that produce leads, cultivate prospects, and finalise transactions. The product manager is required to collaborate with other departments, including sales, marketing and product development, to guarantee that the sales process is optimised and that the product meets client demands. During the last phase of the product management lifecycle, the goal of the product sales teams is to keep up and increase sales of the product. Offering bargains and discounts, entering new markets, or creating new sales channels are a few ways they may do this. Product stakeholders are people or groups of people who want to see product as a success. They may consist of partners, investors, consumers, staff members, and regulators. It is important to communicate with the stakeholders and respond to their valuable feedback. The process of preparing and equipping leaders to accomplish organisational objectives is known as leadership management. It is especially crucial for leaders to be able to handle the difficulties of decline and transition in the last stages of the product lifetime. Apple\u2019s design and development of the iPhone serve as one illustration of product management. Here is this example: The members of the product management team in charge of the iPhone would have needed to: The design and development of the Tesla Model provide yet another illustration. For this model, the product manager would have needed to: "

To get into these companies and organizations as a Python developer, you need to master some important Python Interview Questions to crack their Python Online Assessment Round and Python Interview Round. We have prepared a list of the Top 50 Python Interview Questions along with their answers to ace in interviews. Python Interview Questions Table of Content Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.It is used for: The following are the benefits of using Python language: Actually, Python is a partially compiled language and partially interpreted language. The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code internally this byte code gets converted by the Python virtual machine(p.v.m) according to the underlying platform(machine+operating system). \u2018#\u2019 is used to comment on everything that comes after on the line. Mutable data types can be edited i.e., they can change at runtime. Eg \u2013 List, Dictionary, etc.Immutable data types can not be edited i.e., they can not change at runtime. Eg \u2013 String, Tuple, etc. Everything in Python is an object and all variables hold references to the objects. The reference values are according to the functions; as a result, you cannot change the value of the references. However, you can change the objects if it is mutable. The set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.A dictionary in Python is an ordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map. List comprehension is a syntax construction to ease the creation of a list based on existing iterable. For Example: A lambda function is an anonymous function. This function can have any number of parameters but, can have just one statement. For Example: Pass means performing no operation or in other words, it is a placeholder in the compound statement, where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there. / represents precise division (result is a floating point number) whereas // represents floor division (result is an integer). For Example: There are 3 main keywords i.e. try, except, and finally which are used to catch exceptions and handle the recovering mechanism accordingly. Try is the block of a code that is monitored for errors. Except block gets executed when an error occurs. The beauty of the final block is to execute the code after trying for an error. This block gets executed irrespective of whether an error occurred or not. Finally, block is used to do the required cleanup activities of objects/variables. It is a string\u2019s function that converts all uppercase characters into lowercase and vice versa. It is used to alter the existing case of the string. This method creates a copy of the string which contains all the characters in the swap case. For Example: The \u201cfor\u201d Loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection types such as List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary. Developers use a \u201cfor\u201d loop where they have both the conditions start and the end. Whereas, the \u201cwhile\u201d loop is the actual looping feature that is used in any other programming language. Programmers use a Python while loop where they just have the end conditions. Yes, Several arguments can be passed to a function, including objects, variables (of the same or distinct data types), and functions. Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions because they are objects. Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments. To read more, refer to the article: Passing function as an argument in Python To pass a variable number of arguments to a function in Python, use the special syntax *args and **kwargs in the function specification. It is used to pass a variable-length, keyword-free argument list. By using the *, the variable we associate with the * becomes iterable, allowing you to do operations on it such as iterating over it and using higher-order operations like map and filter. Yes, indentation is required in Python. A Python interpreter can be informed that a group of statements belongs to a specific block of code by using Python indentation. Indentations make the code easy to read for developers in all programming languages but in Python, it is very important to indent the code in a specific order. The location where we can find a variable and also access it if required is called the scope of a variable. Python documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. Typed languages are the languages in which we define the type of data type and it will be known by the machine at the compile-time or at runtime. Typed languages can be classified into two categories: The break statement is used to terminate the loop or statement in which it is present. After that, the control will pass to the statements that are present after the break statement, if available. Continue is also a loop control statement just like the break statement. continue statement is opposite to that of the break statement, instead of terminating the loop, it forces to execute the next iteration of the loop. Pass means performing no operation or in other words, it is a placeholder in the compound statement, where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there. The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python: The Python math module includes a method that can be used to calculate the floor of a number.\u00a0 range() and xrange() are two functions that could be used to iterate a certain number of times in for loops in Python. In Python 3, there is no xrange, but the range function behaves like xrange in Python 2. Dictionary Comprehension is a syntax construction to ease the creation of a dictionary based on the existing iterable. For Example: my_dict = {i:i+7 for i in range(1, 10)} Tuple comprehension is not possible in Python because it will end up in a generator, not a tuple comprehension. Let\u2019s analyze the differences between List and Tuple: List Tuple Shallow copy is used when a new instance type gets created and it keeps values that are copied whereas deep copy stores values that are already copied. A shallow copy has faster program execution whereas a deep copy makes it slow. Python uses the Tim Sort algorithm for sorting. It\u2019s a stable sorting whose worst case is O(N log N). It\u2019s a hybrid sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python as they are the specific change that we make in Python syntax to alter functions easily. By using this command we can debug a Python program: In Python, iterators are used to iterate a group of elements, containers like a list. Iterators are collections of items, and they can be a list, tuples, or a dictionary. Python iterator implements __itr__ and the next() method to iterate the stored elements. We generally use loops to iterate over the collections (list, tuple) in Python. In Python, the generator is a way that specifies how to implement iterators. It is a normal function except that it yields expression in the function. It does not implement __itr__ and next() method and reduces other overheads as well. If a function contains at least a yield statement, it becomes a generator. The yield keyword pauses the current execution by saving its states and then resumes from the same when required. Python does support multiple inheritances, unlike Java. Multiple inheritances mean that a class can be derived from more than one parent class. Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms. So, for instance, if the parent class has a method named ABC then the child class also can have a method with the same name ABC having its own parameters and variables. Python allows polymorphism. Encapsulation means binding the code and the data together. A Python class is an example of encapsulation. Data Abstraction is providing only the required details and hides the implementation from the world. It can be achieved in Python by using interfaces and abstract classes. Python uses its private heap space to manage the memory. Basically, all the objects and data structures are stored in the private heap space. Even the programmer can not access this private space as the interpreter takes care of this space. Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space. We can delete a file using Python by following approaches: Python Slicing is a string operation for extracting a part of the string, or some part of a list. With this operator, one can specify where to start the slicing, where to end, and specify the step. List slicing returns a new list from the existing list. A namespace is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts. PIP is an acronym for Python Installer Package which provides a seamless interface to install various Python modules. It is a command-line tool that can search for packages over the internet and install them without any user interaction. Python zip() function returns a zip object, which maps a similar index of multiple containers. It takes an iterable, converts it into an iterator and aggregates the elements based on iterables passed. It returns an iterator of tuples. The Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using the dump function, this process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling. In Python, the term monkey patch only refers to dynamic modifications of a class or module at run-time. Equivalent to constructors in OOP terminology, __init__ is a reserved method in Python classes. The __init__ method is called automatically whenever a new object is initiated. This method allocates memory to the new object as soon as it is created. This method can also be used to initialize variables. Python uses the \u2018_\u2019 symbol to determine the access control for a specific data member or a member function of a class. A Class in Python has three types of Python access modifiers: Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of the software are tested. This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. The unit test framework is Python\u2019s xUnit style framework. The White Box Testing method is used for Unit testing. Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a type of process lock that is used by Python whenever it deals with processes. Generally, Python only uses only one thread to execute the set of written statements. The performance of the single-threaded process and the multi-threaded process will be the same in Python and this is because of GIL in Python. We can not achieve multithreading in Python because we have a global interpreter lock that restricts the threads and works as a single thread. Function Annotation is a feature that allows you to add metadata to function parameters and return values. This way you can specify the input type of the function parameters and the return type of the value the function returns. Function annotations are arbitrary Python expressions that are associated with various parts of functions. These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in Python\u2019s runtime environment. Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations. They take life when interpreted by third-party libraries, for example, mypy. The latest feature of Python 3.11, Exception Groups. The ExceptionGroup can be handled using a new except* syntax. The * symbol indicates that multiple exceptions can be handled by each except* clause. ExceptionGroup is a collection/group of different kinds of Exception. Without creating Multiple Exceptions we can group together different Exceptions which we can later fetch one by one whenever necessary, the order in which the Exceptions are stored in the Exception Group doesn\u2019t matter while calling them. From version 3.10 upward, Python has implemented a switch case feature called \u201cstructural pattern matching\u201d. You can implement this feature with the match and case keywords. Note that the underscore symbol is what you use to define a default case for the switch statement in Python. Note: Before Python 3.10 Python doesn\u2019t support match Statements. The Walrus Operator allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression. This can be useful when you need to use a value multiple times in a loop, but don\u2019t want to repeat the calculation. The Walrus Operator is represented by the `:=` syntax and can be used in a variety of contexts including while loops and if statements. Note: Python versions before 3.8 doesn\u2019t support Walrus Operator.   "

        "content": "Biology: Biology is the scientific study of life. It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field. Biology encompasses the study of all living organisms, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whales, and the interactions between these organisms and their environment.   This field includes the Anatomy, Physiology, Ecology, and Morphology of living organisms. The definition of biology includes the relationship between plants, animals, microorganisms, and their relation to the environment. Table of Content \u201cThe more I learn about biology,\u00a0the more I realize how incredibly beautiful life is.\u201d \u2013 E.O.\u00a0Wilson Biology is the story of how life unfurled on the Earth. It is the branch of science that deals with life forms and life processes. In earlier times, Biology was only limited to the knowledge of the human body and its function as it formed the basis for medical practice. Fundamental issues regarding how life originated, growth of the biodiversity, and the evolution of living creatures according to different habitats intrigued the biologists. The term \u201cBiology\u201d in Greek is divided into two parts \u2013 bios = life; logos = study, which translates into study of life. Biology is a part of Science, along with Physics and Chemistry. These days Biology is commonly referred to as \u201cLife Sciences\u201d. Biology is a vast field, and many different branches of biology focus on specific aspects of life. Some of the major branches of biology include: The study of biology is essential to understanding the natural world around us. Biology helps to understand the diversity of life, the processes by which living organisms function, and the relationships between different organisms. This knowledge is essential for solving many of the world\u2019s most pressing problems, such as climate change, disease, and food security. The subject of biology has many divisions which are discussed below: In earlier times, man used to live in caves and jungles. He ate fruits and vegetables from the forest and hunted animals. This allowed him to learn about the life and habitats of different plants and animals. This was the beginning of \u2018Biology\u2019. Various drawings and paintings during prehistoric times highlight the fact that early man was interested in plants and animals around him. As man evolved socially, he began domesticating animals like cows, sheep, horses, and dogs, which allowed him to learn more about the ways and lives of these animals. Greeks were the first people who organized the study of Biology. A few of the scientists who were involved with the early study are given below: In India, around 2500 B.C to 650 B.C biology flourished. Animals were being classified as Oviparous and Viviparous. The cultivation of rice began, with over 1000 varieties being the current count. During the 16th century, the invention of Microscope opened a new world of minute animals and plants came to human knowledge. The term \u2018Cell\u2018 was coined which further amplified the study of Biology. Currently, biology has made a great progress in the field of Genetics, Genetic engineering, Antibiotics, Cancer research, cloning, Stem cell research.

These themes include: The study of biology has helped humans advance very far in their field. Few of the examples are given below: Biology is a rapidly evolving field. New discoveries are being made all the time, and new technologies are being developed that allow us to study biology in new ways. For example, the development of gene editing technologies has revolutionized the field of biology and has led to new insights into the causes and treatments of diseases. The future of biology is bright. Biologists are working on solving some of the world\u2019s most pressing problems, such as climate change, disease, and food security. Biology is a fascinating and important science that has a profound impact on our lives. Further Reading: Biology is the scientific study of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environments. It encompasses everything from the smallest cells to complex ecosystems. Aristotle is recognized as the father of biology for his pioneering contributions to the study of living organisms. Biology has several branches, including botany (the study of plants), zoology (the study of animals), microbiology (the study of microorganisms), genetics (the study of heredity), and ecology (the study of ecosystems). Maria Sibylla Merian is celebrated as the mother of biology, known for her detailed observations and illustrations of insects and plants. The discovery of biology as a science is attributed to Thomas Beddoes, who made significant early contributions to the field. Key topics in biology include evolution (the process of how species change over time), genetics (the study of inheritance), photosynthesis (how plants convert sunlight into energy), and cell biology (the study of the basic units of life). Aristotle is also known as the Father of Zoology due to his extensive studies and classifications of various animals. Biology plays a crucial role in medicine by providing the foundation for understanding diseases, the human body, and the development of medical treatments and advancements in healthcare. Martinus Beijerinck is honored as the Father of Virology for his discovery of viruses as a new form of infectious agent. Biodiversity, or the variety of life on Earth, is essential for ecosystem stability and the well-being of all living organisms. It contributes to ecosystem services and supports various human needs.

        "content": "Array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations. It is one of the most popular and simple data structures used in programming. In this article, we have decided to provide a complete guide for Arrays, which will help you to tackle any problem based on Arrays.  Table of Content Array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of items of same data type in contiguous memory locations. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0. We can directly access an array element by using its index value. In an array, all the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. So, if we initialize an array   Arrays can be declared in various ways in different languages. For better illustration, below are some language-specific array declarations: Arrays can be initialized in different ways in different languages. Below are some language-specific array initializations: Assume there is a class of five students and if we have to keep records of their marks in examination then, we can do this by declaring five variables individual and keeping track of records but what if the number of students becomes very large, it would be challenging to manipulate and maintain the data. What it means is that, we can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) when we have a small number of objects. But if we want to store a large number of instances, it becomes difficult to manage them with normal variables. The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable.  Arrays can be classified in two ways:  1. Static Arrays:  In this type of array, memory is allocated at compile time having a fixed size of it. We cannot alter or update the size of this array. This type of memory allocation is also known as static or compile-time memory allocation. Here only a fixed size (i,e. the size that is mentioned in square brackets []) of memory will be allocated for storage. In case, we don\u2019t know the size of the array then if we declare a larger size and store a lesser number of elements will result in a wastage of memory or or we declare a lesser size than the number of elements then we won\u2019t get enough memory to store all the elements. In such cases, static memory allocation is not preferred.  2. Dynamic Arrays: In this type of array, memory is allocated at run time but not having a fixed size. Suppose, a user wants to declare any random size of an array, then we will not use a\u00a0static array, instead of that a dynamic array is used. This type of memory allocation is also known as dynamic or run-time memory allocation. It is used to specify the size of it during the run time of any program. 1. One-dimensional Array(1-D Array): You can imagine a 1d array as a row, where elements are stored one after another.  2. Multi-dimensional Array: A multi-dimensional array is an array with more than one dimension. We can use multidimensional array to store complex data in the form of tables, etc. We can have 2-D arrays, 3-D arrays, 4-D arrays and so on.    Array traversal involves visiting all the elements of the array once. Below is the implementation of Array traversal in different Languages: We can insert one or multiple elements at any position in the array. Below is the implementation of Insertion in Array in different languages: We can delete an element at any index in an array. Below is the implementation of Deletion of element in an array: We can traverse over an array and search for an element. Below is the implementation of Deletion of element in an array: Operation Best Case Average Case Worst Case Traversal \u03a9(N) \u03b8(N) O(N) Insertion \u03a9(1) \u03b8(N) O(N) Deletion \u03a9(1) \u03b8(N) O(N) Searching \u03a9(1) \u03b8(N) O(N) Operation Best Case Average Case Worst Case Traversal \u03a9(1) \u03b8(1) O(1) Insertion \u03a9(1) \u03b8(N) O(N) Deletion \u03a9(1) \u03b8(N) O(N) Searching \u03a9(1) \u03b8(1) O(1) After the discussion, we concluded that arrays are a simple method of accessing elements of the same type by grouping them and we can find the elements efficiently by their indexes and can perform different operations using them. Thus, they are more efficient when it comes to memory allocation and should be used in all modern programming languages. So, this becomes a favorite topic for the perspective of the interview and most of the companies generally asked about the problems on the array. For all these reasons, we must have a good knowledge of it. An array is a collection of items of the same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. Ex. int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}; Arrays store elements of the same type, they are classified as homogeneous data structures. They can store numbers, strings, characters, boolean values (true and false), objects, and so on. \u00a0An array is a linear data structure that stores similar elements in contiguous memory locations. There are majorly two types of arrays: An array is a collection of items of the same data type stored at contiguous memory locations or says the elements are stored one after another in memory. An array uses an index system starting at 0 and going to (n-1), where n is its size. The structure can contain variables of different types but an array only contains variables of the same type.\u00a0 An array is a collection of items of the same data type. That means, in an integer array only integer values can be stored, while in a float array only floating values and character array can have only characters. Thus, no array can have values of two data types. There are multiple advantages of array data structure and some of them are: An array is used when several variables of the same type need to be used, and it can be defined as a sequence of objects of the same type. \u00a0 A multi-dimensional array can be termed as an array of arrays that stores homogeneous data in tabular form. Data in Multidimensional Arrays are stored in row-major order.\u00a0  "

The Docker engine allows you to create and manage docker containers, docker images, docker hub, docker desktop, etc.   In this Docker Tutorial, you\u2019ll learn all the basic to advanced concepts like Docker installation, Docker container, Docker commands, Docker run, Docker images, Docker compose, Docker engine, Docker networking, etc.  If you are here, then it veruy obious that you want to learn the Docker, so here in this section we have listed all the basic intro of Docker. This section will walk you through the steps of installing Docker on your system, whether it\u2019s Windows, macOS, or Linux. We\u2019ll cover the different installation methods, system requirements, and post-installation configurations to ensure you have Docker up and running smoothly, ready to build and run your containerized applications. In this part of the Docker tutorial we will dives into the essential commands you need to navigate the world of Docker.  Whether you\u2019re building, running, or managing containers, this guide equips you with the tools to control your containerized applications. Docker Run refers to the command used in Docker to create and start containers based on Docker images. It\u2019s a fundamental aspect of working with Docker, allowing users to deploy applications and services quickly and efficiently within isolated environments known as containers. Here in this section, you will get to know all the details about the Docker Run. A Docker Image contains everything a container needs to run, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and the operating system it needs. Managing multiple containers can get complex! Docker Compose simplifies this process. In this section we have listed down all the details about the Docker Compose like intro and Compose tools. Docker Engine, also known as Docker Daemon, is the core component of the Docker platform responsible for running and managing Docker containers. Explore this section to get all details about Docker Engine. Docker Networking refers to the set of mechanisms and technologies Docker provides for communication between Docker containers, as well as between containers and the outside world. Go through this section to get more details about Docker Networking. After knowing the Docker Networking, in Docker tutorial, in this section we are going to discuss Docker Registry which is refer as central repository for storing the and managing Docker image.  Explores this section to get to know about the fundamental concepts and practical aspects of utilizing Docker technology to deploy and manage software applications efficiently in this section. Docker Swarm steps in as your reliable organizer, making sure all your containers are in the right place and working well together. Go through this section to get an all about Docker Swarm. Docker Container: A Docker container is a lightweight and executable package of software. It includes everything used to run an application, code, libraries, and dependencies. You don\u2019t need to allocate any memory for the application. It can automatically generate space according to the requirements. A couple of years back, when organizations needed other applications, they buy a server without knowing the performance requirement of the software/application. This results waste of money and resources. Then Virtual machines come onto the market, which allows engineers to run multiple applications on the same resource but as a completely different server. But Every application to run on a Virtual machine requires OS and every OS needs its own CPU, RAM, etc. to run. Which increases the cost. Then Docker Model comes into the scope, which overcomes the drawbacks of the Virtual Machine. It reduces the wastage of resources by sharing OS, memory, and CPU, and It offers many benefits for developers and system administrators, like consistency, portability, efficiency, security, scalability, and version control. These benefits make it easier to manage and deploy applications. Docker is a software development framework that allows you to package and run apps inside virtual machines on a server. It\u2019s often used to create and test applications before deploying them on a real, physical server. This allows organizations to test and deploy their applications quickly and with minimal resources. Docker also makes it easy to package and update apps on any server, regardless of its hardware configuration. Docker uses containerization technology to create and deploy applications in a consistent and isolated environment. It utilizes a client-server architecture where the Docker client interacts with the Docker daemon to build, run, and manage containers. Using Docker can provide benefits such as improved developer productivity, increased application portability, efficient resource utilization, and simplified deployment and scaling of applications. No, Docker uses containerization, which is a lightweight form of virtualization. Unlike traditional virtualization, containers share the host OS kernel and do not require a separate guest OS for each application. To get started with Docker, you can install Docker Desktop or Docker Toolbox based on your operating system. Then, you can create, build, and run your first Docker container using the available documentation and tutorials. Yes, Docker is widely used in production environments to streamline application deployment, facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and enable efficient management of microservices-based architectures.

Web framework Django based on Python. You have good knowledge about Python. Some other concepts you should be familiar with are: In Django, views are the backbone of handling user requests and rendering responses. There are two primary paradigms for implementing views: Function Based Views (FBVs) and Class Based Views (CBVs). Function Based Views offer simplicity and directness, allowing developers to define views as Python functions. Within this paradigm, common functionalities like creating, listing, displaying details, updating, and deleting objects are implemented as separate functions. While both paradigms have their merits, the choice between FBVs and CBVs ultimately depends on factors such as project requirements, development preferences, and scalability concerns. In Django, URL patterns serve as a crucial mechanism for directing incoming requests to the appropriate views within your web application. With the flexibility of regular expressions, Django\u2019s URL dispatcher allows you to define patterns that match specific URL patterns and route them to corresponding views. When dealing with GET parameters passed through URLs in Django, accessing these parameters within views is straightforward, enabling efficient handling of user inputs and customization of responses.  In Django, URLs play a crucial role in navigating through different views and templates within your web application. When working with Django templates, several key concepts enhance the flexibility and functionality of your frontend. Template filters allow you to manipulate variables displayed in your templates, enabling transformations like date formatting or string manipulation.  Models serve as the backbone of database operations, facilitating seamless management of data. This guide delves into various aspects of Django Models, starting from the fundamental operations of inserting, updating, and deleting data using the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) provided by Django. Here, You\u2019ll learn how to create a basic app model, initialize migrations, and execute them to synchronize your database schema. Moreover, we delve into built-in field validations, ensuring data integrity and consistency, while also delving into the customization of these validations to suit specific application requirements. To start, you can create a form using Django Forms by defining a class that inherits from Django\u2019s forms.Form class. Within this class, you can specify the fields you want to include in your form using various field types provided by Django, such as CharField, IntegerField, EmailField, etc. Once you\u2019ve defined your form, you can render HTML forms in Django using both GET and POST methods. Django\u2019s built-in template tags and filters make it easy to render forms in your HTML templates while ensuring security and CSRF protection. Django Forms offer a wide range of field types to cater to different data types and validation requirements. Additionally, you can customize the appearance and behavior of form fields by using form field custom widgets, allowing you to enhance user experience and tailor forms to your specific needs.

In this heap, the value of the root node must be the greatest among all its child nodes and the same thing must be done for its left and right sub-tree also. The total number of comparisons required in the max heap is according to the height of the tree. The height of the complete binary tree is always logn; therefore, the time complexity would also be O(logn). In this heap, the value of the root node must be the smallest among all its child nodes and the same thing must be done for its left and right sub-tree also.

Once the staged changes are to your satisfaction, commit them, and Git will keep a permanent copy of those files in its history. Git is great because it maintains a complete record of each commit you make, allowing you to see GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories and if you have a project hosted on GitHub, you can access and download that project with commands on any computer you have access and make your changes and push the latest version back to GitHub.  GitHub allows you to store your repo on their platform. It is also comes with GitHub, ability to collaborate with other developers from any location.  The tutorial includes instructions on downloading and installing Git, creating new repositories, utilizing Git Bash, managing Git stash, downloading Git, executing Git commands, working with Git branches, etc. and you will also explore more advanced topics such as resolving conflicts, working on Bitbucket and GitHub, etc. Git uses a decentralized model where each developer has their own copy of the repository and works immediately on the project. Git manages the projects with repositories and can clone a project to operate locally on it.  With staging and committing it track changes and control. You can pull the latest code of the project to the local copy, and push local updates to the main projects. Git and GitHub are not the same, GitHub makes tools that use Git. GitHub is the popular host of code and maintained by Microsoft since 2018. Git is a useful tool that helps to manage changes in code or any documents, It generally allows collaboration between developers and writers and enables them easy version control. Yes, Git can be used to manage changes happening in any text-based files, documents, configuration files, and even images. However, Git may not be the best tool for managing large binary files. When changes areStart done in the same file by different developers then conflict occurred. To solve this, you need to first identify the lines of code which is conflicting then make the necessary changes, and commit the changes to the repository. Git is a version control system used to track changes that generally occur in code and documents. GitHub is a platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and different tools for collaboration. "

        "content": "Commerce is concerned with the activities involving taking goods and services from manufacturers and delivering them to users. The basic motive of commerce is ensuring the proper flow of goods and services in the market for the ease of manufacturers and consumers. With the help of commerce, an individual can purchase goods produced in any part of the world. Commerce not only includes the buying and selling of goods but also consists of all the activities or services like transportation, banking, insurance, communication, packaging, advertisement, warehousing, etc., required to facilitate the process of trade, i.e., buying and selling of goods. Hence, commerce provides the required link between manufacturers and consumers. Commerce can be further classified into two parts: trade and auxiliaries to trade. \u00a0 Academically, along with Science and Arts, Commerce is said to be one of the most popular streams of education. It deals with the various aspects of business, trade, accounting, financial information/transactions and merchandising. It is a study of trade and business activities, dealing with accounting and financial activities. Accountancy, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Statistics for Economics, Indian Economic Development and Business Studies are the major subjects in this stream. Further in higher standards, Commerce is divided into many subjects like Management, Marketing, Income Tax, Financial Management, Organisational Behaviour, Entrepreneurship & Small Business Management, International Marketing Management, Business Mathematics, Cost Accounting, Money & Banking, etc. Subjects which are taught in Class XI and XII are Accountancy, Business Studies, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Indian Economic Development, and Statistics for Economics. Accountancy deals with the process of measuring, processing and recording an organization\u2019s financial and non-financial statements. It has a wider scope than Accounting as it is the route to the Accounting process. Accountancy is responsible for prescribing the accounting conventions, principles, and techniques to be followed by an organization during the accounting process. The nature of Accounting is dynamic and analytical and hence, requires special abilities and skills in an individual to interpret the information better and effectively.\u00a0 Business Studies is defined as the area of study that talks about the principles of business, economics and management. It is taught at the secondary level in India as an academic elective. It covers management, marketing, and finance.\u00a0 GeeksforGeeks Business Studies covers chapters from Class XI and XII covering every topic, like Business, Commerce, Forms of Business Organisation, Business Services, Business Finance, Social Responsibility, Business Ethics, International Business, Functions of Management, Principles of Management, Marketing, Stock Exchange, Training, Recruiting, Planning, etc. Economics is the study of a way in which a society decides or chooses to use limited resources with alternate uses for the production of goods and services and to ultimately distribute the product among different sections of the society. Simply put, economics is about choosing among different alternatives in the presence of scarcity. It aims to ensure that the resources are used in the best possible manner. Economics is further divided into many subjects, like in school we have Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Statistics for Economics and Indian Economic Development. a. Microeconomics: Microeconomics is a branch of economics studying the behaviour of an individual economic unit. Adam Smith is known as the father of economics and microeconomics. Microeconomics help in contemplating the attributes of different decision-makers in an economy like individuals, enterprises, and households. In simple terms, microeconomics help in understanding why and how different goods have different values, how individuals make certain decisions, and how they cooperate with each other.\u00a0 b. Statistics for Economics: Statistics for Economics plays a major role in economics. Statistics helps in the study of market structure and understanding the different economic problems. After a better understanding of the economic problems, statistics also help in solving those issues by formulating appropriate economic policies. Every economics branch takes the help of statistics to prove different economic theories. One can also establish a mathematical relationship with the help of statistics. Economists can present the facts of economics precisely. c. Macroeconomics: Macroeconomics is a part of economics that focuses on how general economies, markets, or different systems that operate on a large scale behave. Macroeconomics concentrates on phenomena like inflation, price levels, rate of economic growth, national income, gross domestic product (GDP) and changes in unemployment. d. Indian Economic Development: Indian Economic Development as a subject is to familiarise students with the basic feature of the Indian Economy and its process of development. It is important to first look at the state of India\u2019s economy prior to the country\u2019s independence and form an idea of the various consideration that shaped India\u2019s post-independence development strategy. Management is an essential ingredient in every organised endeavour. Effective and efficient coordination of human efforts and material resources requires sound management. This part has been designed keeping in view the situational nature of management. It seeks to provide a brief and concise view of what management is all about and how it can be applied to different spheres of human activity.\u00a0 Income Tax is a direct tax that is levied on any individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s income during a financial year. It is directly paid to the government, like all the other direct taxes. The net taxable income is considered to calculate the tax liability of the individual or entity based on the income slabs provided by the Income-tax Department for the current financial year. The amount of tax paid depends on the money earned by the individual in that particular financial year. The specialised study of how an individual or a company manages its funds is known as Finance. It refers to the money required for carrying out business activities. It involves all activities right from the estimation of funds to their acquisition, utilization and disposal. Finance is the lifeblood of any business. S "

        "content": "Branch and bound algorithms are used to find the optimal solution for combinatory, discrete, and general mathematical optimization problems. A branch and bound algorithm provide an optimal solution to an NP-Hard problem by exploring the entire search space. Through the exploration of the entire search space, a branch and bound algorithm identify possible candidates for solutions step-by-step. There are many optimization problems in computer science, many of which have a finite number of the feasible shortest path in a graph or minimum spanning tree that can be solved in polynomial time. Typically, these problems require a worst-case scenario of all possible permutations. The branch and bound algorithm create branches and bounds for the best solution. In this tutorial, we\u2019ll discuss the branch and bound method in detail. The Branch \u00a0algorithms incorporate different search techniques to traverse a state space tree. Different search techniques used in B&B are listed below: 1. LC search (Least Cost Search): It uses a heuristic cost function to compute the bound values at each node. Nodes are added to the list of live nodes as soon as they get generated.The node with the least value of a cost function selected as a next E-node. 2.BFS(Breadth First Search):It is also known as a FIFO search.It maintains the list of live nodes in first-in-first-out order i.e, in a queue, The live nodes are searched in the FIFO order to make them next E-nodes. 3. DFS (Depth First Search):It is also known as a LIFO search.It maintains the list of live nodes in last-in-first-out order i.e. in a stack. The live nodes are searched in the LIFO order to make them next E-nodes. Introduction to Branch and Bound Branch and bound is an effective solution to some problems, which we have already discussed. We\u2019ll discuss all such cases where branching and binding are appropriate in this section. \u25b8 Generation of a state space tree: As in the case of backtracking, B&B generates a state space tree to efficiently search the solution space of a given problem instance. In B&B, all children of an E-node in a state space tree are produced before any live node gets converted in an E-node. Thus, the E-node remains an E-node until i becomes a dead node. Unlike backtracking, B&B needs additional factors evaluate a candidate solution: It optimizes the search for a solution vector in the solution space of a given problem instance. It is a heuristic function that evaluates the lower and upper bounds on the possible solutions at each node. The bound values are used to search the partial solutions leading to an optimal solution. If a node does not produce a solution better than the best solution obtained thus far, then it is abandoned without further exploration. The algorithm then branches to another path to get a better solution. The desired solution to the problem is the value of the best solution produced so far. \u25b8 The reasons to dismiss a search path at the current node : (i) The bound value of the node is lower than the upper bound in the case of the maximization problem and higher than the lower bound in the case of the minimization problem. (i.e. the bound value of the ade is not better than the value of the best solution obtained until that node). (ii) The node represents infeasible solutions, de violation of the constraints of the problem. (iii) The node represents a subset of a feasible solution containing a single point. In this case, if the latest solution is better than the best solution obtained so far the best solution is modified to the value of a feasible solution at that node. The solution of the Branch and the bound problem can be represented in two ways: The Branch and Bound method can be classified into three types based on the order in which the state space tree is searched.\u00a0 We will now discuss each of these methods in more detail. To denote the solutions in these methods, we will use the variable solution method. First-In-First-Out is an approach to the branch and bound problem that uses the queue approach to create a state-space tree. In this case, the breadth-first search is performed, that is, the elements at a certain level are all searched, and then the elements at the next level are searched, starting with the first child of the first node at the previous level. For a given set {A, B, C, D}, the state space tree will be constructed as follows : State Space tree for set {A, B, C, D} The above diagram shows that we first consider element A, then element B, then element C and finally we\u2019ll consider the last element which is D. We are performing BFS while exploring the nodes. So, once the first level is completed. We\u2019ll consider the first element, then we can consider either B, C, or D. If we follow the route then it says that we are doing elements A and D so we will not consider elements B and C. If we select the elements A and D only, then it says that we are selecting elements A and D and we are not considering elements B and C. Selecting element A Now, we will expand node 3, as we have considered element B and not considered element A, so, we have two options to explore that is elements C and D. Let\u2019s create nodes 9 and 10 for elements C and D respectively. Considered element B and not considered element A Now, we will expand node 4 as we have only considered elements C and not considered elements A and B, so, we have only one option to explore which is element \u00a0D. Let\u2019s create node 11 for D. \u00a0Considered elements C and not considered elements A and B Till node 5, we have only considered elements D, and not selected elements A, B, and C. So, We have no more elements to explore, Therefore on node 5, there won\u2019t be any expansion. Now, we will expand node 6 as we have considered elements A and B, so, we have only two option to explore that is element C and D. Let\u2019s create node 12 and 13 for C and D respectively. Expand node 6 Now, we will expand node 7 as we have considered elements A and C and not consider element B, so, we have only one option to explore which is element \u00a0D. Let\u2019s create node 14 for D. Expand node 7 Till node 8, we have considered elements A and D, and not selected elements B and C, So, We have no more elements to explore, Therefore on node 8, there won\u2019t be any expansion. Now, we will expand node 9 as we have considered elements B and C and not considered element A, so, we have only one option to explore which is element \u00a0D. Let\u2019s create node 15 for D. Expand node 9 The Last-In-First-Out approach for this problem uses stack in creating the state space tree. When nodes are added to a state space tree, they are added to a stack. After all nodes of a level have been added, we pop the topmost element from the stack and explore it. For a given set {A, B, C, D}, the state space tree will be constructed as follows : State space tree for element {A, B, C, D} Now the expansion would be based on the node that appears on the top of the stack. Since node 5 appears on the top of the stack, so we will expand node 5. We will pop out node 5 from the stack. Since node 5 is in the last element, i.e., D so there is no further scope for expansion. The next node that appears on the top of the stack is node 4. Pop-out node 4 and expand. On expansion, element D will be considered and node 6 will be added to the stack shown below: Expand node 4 The next node is 6 which is to be expanded. Pop-out node 6 and expand. Since node 6 is in the last element, i.e., D so there is no further scope for expansion. The next node to be expanded is node 3. Since node 3 works on element B so node 3 will be expanded to two nodes, i.e., 7 and 8 working on elements C and D respectively. Nodes 7 and 8 will be pushed into the stack. The next node that appears on the top of the stack is node 8. Pop-out node 8 and expand. Since node 8 works on element D so there is no further scope for the expansion. Expand node 3 The next node that appears on the top of the stack is node 7. Pop-out node 7 and expand. Since node 7 works on element C so node 7 will be further expanded to node 9 which works on element D and node 9 will be pushed into the stack. The next node is 6 which is to be expanded. Pop-out node 6 and expand. Since node 6 is in the last element, i.e., D so there is no further scope for expansion. Expand node 7 The next node that appears on the top of the stack is node 9. Since node 9 works on element D, there is no further scope for expansion. The next node that appears on the top of the stack is node 2. Since node 2 works on the element A so it means that node 2 can be further expanded. It can be expanded up to three nodes named 10, 11, 12 working on elements B, C, and D respectively. There new nodes will be pushed into the stack shown as below: Expand node 2 In the above method, we explored all the nodes using the stack that follows the LIFO principle. To explore the state space tree, this method uses the cost function. The previous two methods also calculate the cost function at each node but the cost is not been used for further exploration. In this technique, nodes are explored based on their costs, the cost of the node can be defined using the problem and with the help of the given problem, we can define the cost function. Once the cost function is defined, we can define the cost of the node.Now, Consider a node whose cost has been determined. If this value is greater than U0, this node or its children will not be able to give a solution. As a result, we can kill this node and not explore its further branches. As a result, this method prevents us from exploring cases that are not worth it, which makes it more efficient for us.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first consider node 1 having cost infinity shown below: In the following diagram, node 1 is expanded into four nodes named 2, 3, 4, and 5. Node 1 is expanded into four nodes named 2, 3, 4, and 5 Assume that cost of the nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5 are 12, 16, 10, and 315 respectively.In this method, we will explore the node which is having the least cost. In the above figure, we can observe that the node with a minimum cost is node 4. So, we will explore node 4 having a cost of 10. During exploring node 4 which is element C, we can notice that there is only one possible element that remains unexplored which is D (i.e, we already decided not to select elements A, and B). So, it will get expanded to one single element D, let\u2019s say this node number is 6. Exploring node 4 which is element C Now, Node 6 has no element left to explore. So, there is no further scope for expansion. Hence the element {C, D} is the optimal way to choose for the least cost. The Branch and Bound method can be used for solving most combinatorial problems. Some of these problems are given below: Question The branch and bound algorithms are one of the most popular algorithms used in optimization problems that we have discussed in our tutorial. We have also explained when a branch and bound algorithm is appropriate for a user to use. In addition, we presented an algorithm based on branches and bounds for assigning jobs. Lastly, we discussed some advantages and disadvantages of branch and bound algorithms. H "

The difference between the heights of the left subtree and the right subtree for any node is known as the balance factor of the node. The AVL tree is named after its inventors, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper \u201cAn algorithm for the organization of information\u201d.
